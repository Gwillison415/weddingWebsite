# weddingWebsite
in order to save a small amount of money.. I made this full stack app. It was really fun, I learned things... 
I won't be doing it again... 
But mostly because i'm getting married!!! 
So I'll just have to do something different.


This responsive Wedding RSVP app is built with React, Redux, Express and PostgreSQL.
It's purpose for guests is to allow  access to pertinent info and to standardize response channels, for everything from rsvp's to allergies. including a mailer configured to your wedding email account for creating and sending info to guests. 
It's purpose for the happy couple is to import a UTF-8 csv of all of our guests and allow them to give us their info asynchronously and then sweep up our totals at a moments notice.
